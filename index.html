          I can show you the world
          Shining, shimmering, splendid
          Tell me, princess, now when did
          You last let your heart decide?
          I can open your eyes
          Take you wonder by wonder
          Over, sideways and under
          On a magic carpet ride
          <hr>
          A whole new world
          A new fantastic point of view
          No one to tell us, "No"
          Or where to go
          Or say we're only dreaming
          A whole new world
          A dazzling place I never knew
          But when I'm way up here
          It's crystal clear
          That now I'm in a whole new world with you
          (Now I'm in a whole new world with you)
          <hr>
          Unbelievable sights
          Indescribable feeling
          Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
          Through an endless diamond sky
          A whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes)
          A hundred thousand things to see (hold your breath, it gets better)
          I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
          I can't go back to where I used to be
          <hr>
          A whole new world
          With new horizons to pursue
          I'll chase them anywhere
          There's time to spare
          Let me share this whole new world with you
          A whole new world (a whole new world)
          A new fantastic point of view
          No one to tell us, "No"
          Or where to go
          Or say we're only dreaming
          <hr>
          A whole new world (every turn, a surprise)
          With new horizons to pursue (every moment, red-letter)
          I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
          And then we're home (there's time to spare)
          Let me share this whole new world with you
          A whole new world (a whole new world)
          That's where we'll be (that's where we'll be)
          A thrilling chase (a wondrous place)
          For you and me
